1. 
   a. 0.1A * 5V = 0.5W (Absorbed)
   b. -0.4A * 12V = -4.8W (Supplied)
   c. 12mA * -12.5mV = -150uW (Supplied)
   d. 2mA * -15mV = -75uW (Supplied)

2. 
   a. P1 = 20mA * 1mV = 20uW (cktt2 absorbs)
   b. P1 = 10mA * 50mV = 500uW (ckt2 absorbs)
   c. P1 = 22mA * -25mV = -550uW (ckt2 supplies)

3. 
   a. P2 = 1mA * 200mV = 200uW (ckt2 absorbs)
   b. P2 = 10mW (same voltage and shared current) (ck2 absorbs)
   c. P2 = 175mW (ck2 absorbs)

4. 
   a. P3 =
