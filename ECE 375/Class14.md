# Class 14

Last class we learned about different programmable hardware types. We used to use arrays of gates and programming the interconnections.

In modern FPGAs, we can just use look up tables.

### Look up Tables (LUT)

Instead of actually implementing the hardware, we can just use a bunch of look up tables to reprogram the same hardware to different functions

### FPGAs

An integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer **after** manufacturing.

Programmed using HDLs such as VHDL and Verilog.
