### K-Maps (Karnough Maps)

Allows you to simplify expressions without using the theorems

F(A, B)

Truth table

| A   | B   | F   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |
F = A'B' + A'B
If you simplify using theorems, then you would find F= A'

K-map for F

| A\B   | 0   | 1   |
| ----- | --- | --- |
| **0** | 1   | 1   |
| **1** | 0   | 0   |
You can pair up the ones so you get A'

---

| A\B   | 0   | 1   |
| ----- | --- | --- |
| **0** | 1   | 1   |
| **1** | 1   | 0   |
F = A' + B'
or
F = (AB)'

#### 3 Variable K-Maps
(A, B, C)
**Only have one bit change**

| A\BC  | 00  | 01  | 11  | 10  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0** |     |     |     |     |
| **1** |     |     |     |     |
Could also do this

| AB\C   | 0   | 1   |
| ------ | --- | --- |
| **00** |     |     |
| **01** |     |     |
