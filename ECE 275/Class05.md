# Class 4

### Number Systems

1. Decimal System : 0-9 (Base 10) -- Used in everything
2. Binary System : 0-1 (Base 2) -- Used in Digital Logic
3. Octal System : 0-7 (Base 8) -- Used in Avionics and Unix
4. Hexadecimal System : 0-F (Base 16) -- Used in Embedded

## VHDL (VHSIC HDL)
(Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Descriptive Language)
Also Verilog/System Verilog

You can realize hardware with HDLs.

BDF -> VHDL -> FPGA

**FPGA = Field Programmable Gate Array**
|-> Reconfigurable
|-> Can test

**ASIC = Application Specific Integrated Circuit**
|-> Gets fabricated
|-> Not reconfigurable

CPLD = Complex Programmable Logic Devices
|-> Out of scope for this course

SOC = System on Chip

#### Compiling Pipeline
Design -> Synthesis (Compile) -> Logic Diagrams & Netlist -> Place & Route
